description: "Diagnose an ITSOLPowers Codex subagent setup without changing files. Use when custom Codex roles are missing, not discovered, use unexpected models or reasoning, agent limits appear wrong, setup was partial, managed files may have drifted, or a user wants to verify ~/.codex/agents, .codex/agents, config.toml, and ITSOLPowers managed state."

# ITSOL Codex Doctor

Inspect configuration only. Do not repair, install, remove, or force changes from this skill.

## Workflow

1. Determine `user` or explicit `project` scope. Default to user scope.
2. Resolve the sibling `itsol-codex-setup` skill directory.
3. Run:

```bash
node <setup-skill-dir>/scripts/configure-codex.mjs doctor --scope user --json
```

For project scope, add `--scope project --project-root <path>`.

4. Report:
   - Codex CLI availability/version;
   - managed-state validity and selected preset;
   - missing or modified roles;
   - `[agents]` parsing and limit conflicts;
   - configured sandbox intent;
   - model entitlement as `unverified` unless normal Codex runtime evidence proves it.
5. Recommend `$itsol-codex-setup` only for concrete repair actions. A new task or application reload may be needed after role changes, but do not claim one exact reload behavior across all surfaces.

## Status

- `completed`: configuration is structurally consistent; informational uncertainty may remain.
- `partial`: setup exists but user changes, unavailable CLI, or less-restrictive limits need attention.
- `failed`: state, required role files, or configuration are missing or malformed.

Never invoke a model to test entitlement, never modify files, and never add `maxTurns`.
