# UI Code Review

Review UI as user-facing behavior: consistency, task completion, accessibility, responsive behavior, performance, and test evidence matter more than visual preference.

## Process

1. Inspect the diff, screenshots, changed components, existing nearby patterns, tests, routes, state/data flow, tokens and responsive behavior.
2. Build a UI review coverage map: design system, component architecture, UX states/forms/lists, responsive/media, Tailwind/tokens, accessibility/motion, performance/stability, tests/QA, and security-sensitive browser rendering.
3. For large frontend PRs, use subagents by focused UI area before producing the final verdict.
4. Verify the UI works for loading, empty, error, partial data, permission denied, readonly/disabled, long text, many records, mobile, keyboard and slow network when relevant.
5. Lead with concrete findings by severity, with file references and affected user behavior.
6. Treat missing screenshots, missing responsive evidence, missing a11y checks, missing visual/behavior tests, or unreviewed new patterns as review risks.

## What To Review

- Existing components and tokens are reused.
- New components are necessary and have simple APIs.
- Variants are semantic.
- Tailwind classes use tokens and avoid random values.
- All relevant UI states are handled.
- Accessibility and keyboard behavior work.
- Responsive layouts are intentional.
- Layout does not shift during loading/refetch.
- Animations are justified and respect reduced motion.
- Tests cover user-visible behavior.
- Errors, empty states and disabled states are understandable.
- Security-sensitive rendering avoids untrusted HTML and unsafe links.
- Component responsibilities are not mixed.
- Performance is reasonable for realistic data.

## Reviewer Questions

- Does this look like the same application?
- Does a similar pattern already exist?
- Should the new component enter the design system?
- Does the variant name describe intent?
- Can a user complete the action without a mouse?
- Can a screen reader user understand the form?
- Does the view work with empty data?
- Does background refetch preserve user context?
- Is mobile an intentional layout, not a squeezed desktop?
- Does long text break anything?
- Does the loading state match final dimensions?
- Does animation explain state or hide a performance issue?
- Does the test verify behavior instead of implementation?

## Large PR Subagent Split

For large UI PRs, use focused review subagents:

- `ui-design-system` for tokens, variants, base components and consistency;
- `ui-component-architecture` for decomposition and ownership;
- `ui-view-states-forms` for states, forms, tables, API/cache and optimistic UI;
- `ui-responsive-media` for mobile/tablet/desktop/media behavior;
- `ui-tailwind-tokens` for utility class and token usage;
- `ui-accessibility-motion` for keyboard, focus, ARIA and reduced motion;
- `ui-performance-stability` for CLS, Core Web Vitals, large lists and heavy imports;
- `ui-frontend-testing-qa` for tests, visual regression and QA evidence;
- `security-frontend-browser-review` when rendering, storage, links, uploads, auth state, CSP or browser trust boundary changes.

The main agent consolidates findings, removes duplicates, orders by severity and states coverage gaps.

## Minimum Blocking Risks

Consider blocking when:

- primary flow has no loading/error/empty state;
- form lacks labels or visible field errors;
- primary action is unavailable by keyboard or mobile;
- UI exposes action/data without backend enforcement evidence;
- untrusted HTML is rendered without security review;
- responsive layout has unusable horizontal scroll;
- layout shift breaks task flow;
- new base component lacks accessible behavior or tests;
- critical UI behavior has no verification.
