# ML AI Project Planning

Plan ML and AI work from the decision, data, risk, and operating model before choosing a model. Use this skill to decide whether ML is appropriate, define success, and create an actionable project card.

## Process

1. Start from the business decision, user, prediction unit, prediction moment, available data, target, latency, cost, audit, privacy, and owner.
2. Check whether deterministic rules, search, a parser, a heuristic, or the current process can solve the problem with lower risk than ML.
3. Quantify false positive, false negative, abstain/no-decision, latency, compute, operational, and review costs.
4. Define how uncertainty is represented and when the system falls back, asks for human review, or refuses to decide.
5. Establish a baseline before proposing complex models. Do not approve large training work without a stable evaluator and baseline.
6. Choose business metrics, model metrics, segment reporting, guardrails, minimum useful improvement, and release acceptance criteria together.
7. Read [references/guide.md](references/guide.md), then load only the focused reference files needed for the planning question.
8. Produce a project card or planning report with scope, assumptions, data needs, evaluation plan, phases, risks, and explicit non-goals.

## Coordination

Use with `ml-data-evaluation` when datasets, splits, leakage, metrics, eval datasets, or error analysis are in scope. Use `ml-serving-mlops-review` when rollout, monitoring, retraining, rollback, model cards, or production review are in scope. For Rust/Rig/Candle implementation details, route to the existing `rust-ml-llm-*` skills first.
